# Subscription Solidity Contract

This repository demonstrates how I developed a **fully functional Subscription** contract in Solidity through an iterative learning process with ChatGPT. It includes subscription handling, monthly payments, refunds, and security best practices.

---

## Project Journey

### Step 1: Starting Simple
- Initial goal: Create a basic subscription contract.
- Features:
  - Users can subscribe by paying Ether.
  - Track subscription expiration.
  - Owner can withdraw collected funds.
- Focus: Readability and learning key Solidity concepts (mappings, timestamps, ownership).

---

### Step 2: Adding Advanced Features
- Requested features:
  - Support for multiple subscription periods at once.
  - Event logging for off-chain tracking.
  - Automatic extension of existing subscriptions.
- Learnings:
  - Usage of `onlyOwner` modifiers.
  - Event-driven design (`Subscribed`, `PriceUpdated`).

---

### Step 3: Handling Refunds
- Added functionality:
  - Users can cancel subscriptions and get pro-rated refunds.
  - Safe state updates before transferring Ether.
  - Cancellation events for off-chain monitoring.
- Learnings:
  - Reentrancy risks and prevention.
  - Pro-rated refund calculations.

---

### Step 4: Security with OpenZeppelin
- Integrated `ReentrancyGuard` for withdrawal and refund safety.
- Maintained simplicity while following industry security standards.
- Reinforced the importance of `nonReentrant` in Ether transfers.

---

### Step 5: Monthly Subscription Logic
- Implemented recurring monthly payments:
  - `subscriptionDuration` can be set to 30 days.
  - Users pay per month or multiple months in advance.
  - Expired subscriptions automatically become inactive.
- Key point: Ethereum cannot auto-charge users; each payment must be triggered manually.

---

### Step 6: Testing and Optimization
- Learned how to test **specific functions** in Forge using `--match-test`.
- Debugged balance issues related to refunds.
- Applied basic gas optimizations:
  - Used `immutable` for owner.
  - Applied `unchecked` arithmetic where safe.

---

## Key Features of the Final Contract
- Multi-period subscription payments.
- Monthly recurring logic.
- Refunds and cancellations with pro-rated calculations.
- Secure withdrawal patterns (`ReentrancyGuard`).
- Event-driven design for off-chain tracking.
- Gas-efficient design patterns for educational purposes.
